🎮 Hang_man Word Game

Welcome to the Hangman Word Game — a fun and challenging twist on the classic word-guessing puzzle! 🧠✨

Can you guess the hidden word before your 6 chances run out? Each wrong letter brings you one step closer to being hanged (don’t worry — just the stick figure 😅).

A random word is chosen — but hidden!

Guess one letter at a time.

For every wrong guess, a part of the hangman appears.

Guess the full word before it’s too late to win the game.
